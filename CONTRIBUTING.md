# Contributing Guide

## Disclaimer!

TODO: Flesh out the 'legalness' of this statement.
By submitting code to this repository, it no longer belongs
to you and is property of WISER.

## Project Roles

The WISER project has 4 roles: the benevolent dictator
of life, maintainers, committers, and contributors. If you
have heard these terms before, great! If not, also great!
We are glad WISER is the first place you will learn about
them.

### Benevolent Dictator of Life (BDFL)
The benevolent dictator of life is the person who has the
final say on all major project decisions. Their role is
to lead the project in a direction that satisfies its
mission but also satisfies the community. It is not
uncommon for the BDFL to resolve disputes on project
direction for the open-source software. The BDFL of
WISER is Bethany Ehlmann.

### Maintainer
A maintainer doesn't have to write code. A maintainer for
WISER is defined in very broad terms: someone who has
responsibility over the direction of the project and is
committed to improving it. WISER's current maintainers are
listed below:
1. Joshua Garcia-Kimble

#### Becoming a maintainer
TODO: Flush this out with Bethany

Becoming a maintainer of WISER isn't a set-in-stone process.
It is mainly dependent on if the BDFL thinks that you should
be a maintainer. To increase your odds of becoming a maintainer
it would be good to make consistent contributions to the project,
voice your opinion about the direction the project should take
in the community, and by interfacing with the BDFL and current
maintainers. This would build trust between WISER's 'upper-brass'
and your. 

### Committer
A committer has more to do with making 'commits' to the repository.
A commit is simply a change to the repository. It is likely to either
be code or documentation.

#### Becoming a committer
TODO: Flush this out with Bethany

Like with becoming a maintainer, becoming a committer of WISER
isn't a set-in-stone process. It is mainly dependent on if the
BDFL and the maintainers think that you should be a committer.
To increase your odds of becoming a committer it would be good
to make active contributions involving either writing good
code or good documentation. Interfacing with the BDFL and the
current maintainers is necessary in order to build trust.
Unlike becoming a maintainer, is not as important to actively
voice your opinion on the direction of the project. This is
because a committers primary role in the project is ensuring
quality code and documentation gets merged into the repository
as quickly as is responsible.


### Contributor
Good news, anyone can be a contributor! I love the definition
[here](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/) so much
that I will just quote it and add a bit more.

> **A “contributor” could be anyone** who comments on an
issue or pull request, people who add value to the project
(whether it’s triaging issues, writing code, or organizing
events), or anybody with a merged pull request (perhaps the
narrowest definition of a contributor).

I would like to add a contributor can also be anyone
who helps answer issues in the community or track down bugs
or actively tests the software. Really, it just means anyone
who contributes to making the WISER project better.

#### How to contribute
There are some ways to contribute that are well-defined. 
There are other ways to contribute that aren't so well-defined.

For the well-defined ways, you can can look through the issues on the github and tackle them. Some issues will be marked with
beginner to signal that it is a good way for new contributors to get experience with WISER. Contributions 
here can be in the form of either code or documentation or
simply a useful comment on the issue. 

If you have an idea that is not on the issue tracker, you
can make an issue for it. However, if this is a new feature
then make sure it aligns with WISER's mission and make sure
a maintainer comments on if this new feature aligns with
the mission of WISER before you code. That way you don't
put in a lot of work to not see the new feature make it into
the project. Learn more about creating issues for feature
requests here (TODO: Make the page for submitting feature requests).

You can also get in contact with the maintainers or BDFL
if you want to do other forms of contributions like triaging
issues, planning events, or anything else. A good way to 
do this is to use our forum (TODO: Figure out a WISER forum
to use). Emailing the BDFL or maintainer is not recommended
as the forum is a better options to keep track of everything
in one place (TODO: Depending on the forum we use, we may
need to email, but hopefully not).
