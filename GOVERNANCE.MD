# Governance

## Overview
The governance describes how the project hierarchy is handled.
That is to say, how are decisions made for the direction of the
project and how disputes are handled over these types of
decisions. There are three main types of governance: benevolent
dictator for life (BDFL), meritocracy, and liberal contribution.
They each have a different way of making decisions for their
project.


## WISER's Governance
WISER will be a benevolent dictator for life model where the benevolent
dictator is Bethany Ehlmann. This means that she has the final say on
all of the big picture decisions for the direction that WISER goes
(i.e. what types of features we should be implementing, what types of
improvements we should be making, what types of outreach we should
do, etc.) and must resolve disputes in the community over the
direction things should go.

It should be noted that the term benevolent dictator should not
be viewed with the fear that the benevolent dictator will 'rule with an
iron fist'. It is actually quiet the opposite. Because how easy it
is for open-source projects to be forked, the benevolent dictator
must appeal to the community of users and developers. All three parties
have the best interest of the project in mind, it is the benevolent
dictator who must make sure that all three parties are satisfied. The
benevolent dictator is better thought of as a 'benevolent mediator' or
'benevolent guider'. Read more information [here](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/).
