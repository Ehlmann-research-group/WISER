# WISER's Mission Statement

WISER exists to make imaging spectroscopy data accessible, intuitive, and 
usable for the entire planetary science community. Imaging spectrometers 
provide rich, per-pixel spectral information, but current tools are 
either expensive, fragmented, or require programming expertise that 
limits who can participate in analysis. WISER’s central mission is to 
provide a free, open-source, extensible software platform that unifies 
interactive visualization, advanced analytical tools, and 
community-driven plug-ins in one environment. We hae this mission to 
empower researchers, educators, and students to explore, interpret, and 
innovate with spectral datasets, expanding scientific discovery and 
broadening participation in planetary remote sensing.
