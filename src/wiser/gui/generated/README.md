# Generated Files

This directory is the target location for a number of files generated by Qt 6
tools.  **Note that these files may be different for different versions of the
Qt tools!**  Thus, it is wisest to auto-generate them locally before trying to
run the application from sources.

*   `*_ui.py` files are user-interface initialization and layout files
    generated by `pyside6-uic` from the `.ui` files in `../ui_files`.  These
    files can be edited with the Qt Designer tool.

    Note that the `Makefile` that generates these files is located in the
    `..` parent directory.

*   `resources.py` contains SVG icon resources generated by running
    `pyside6-rcc` on the `../../resources/resources.qrc` file.

    Note that the `Makefile` that generates this file is located in the
    `../..` grand-parent directory.
