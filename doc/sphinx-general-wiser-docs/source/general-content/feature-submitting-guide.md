# Feature Submitting Guide

Thank you for helping improve **WISER**!  
Before submitting a feature request, please review the following guidelines.

## How to Submit a Feature Request
All new feature requests should be submitted as a **GitHub issue** using the  
**Feature request** issue template.

When filling out the template:
- Clearly describe the **problem** your feature aims to solve.  
- Propose a **solution** and explain how it fits with **WISER’s mission**.  
- Include any **alternatives** or design ideas you’ve considered.  
- Add **context, screenshots, or examples** if applicable.

## Review Process
Feature requests should align with **WISER’s mission**.  
Not all requests will be accepted — some may require **discussion and iteration** to refine into a concrete, well-scoped solution.

Please be patient and open to feedback. Feature development may take time depending on project priorities.
