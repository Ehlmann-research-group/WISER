Getting started
===============

This page hosts the documentation for how to get started using WISER from source and
contributing to WISER. There will be information how environment setup, WISER's CI/CD 
pipelines, PR best practices, and documentation on the code.

Prerequisites
-------------

WISER currently runs on MacOS 15 (both ARM and Intel) and Windows 10/11. Building
from source on linux has not been tested, so bugs may occur if you try.
