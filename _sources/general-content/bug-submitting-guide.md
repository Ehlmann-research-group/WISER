# Bug Submitting Guide

Thank you for helping make **WISER** better!  
If you find a problem or unexpected behavior, please **submit it as a GitHub issue** using the **Bug report** template.

## How to Submit a Bug Report
You can submit a new bug report here:  
👉 [**Submit a Bug Report**](https://github.com/Ehlmann-research-group/WISER/issues/new/choose)

When filling out the issue form:
- Clearly **describe the bug** — what went wrong and where.  
- Include **steps to reproduce** the problem (numbered if possible).  
- State what you **expected to happen** versus what actually occurred.  
- Add **screenshots or console messages** if they help explain the issue.  
- Include details about your **system setup**:
  - Operating System (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)  
  - CPU architecture (x86_64, ARM, etc.)  
  - WISER version (e.g., `1.4b1`)

If there’s an error message, paste it under **Error Message**, and add any **additional context** that might help reproduce or understand the bug.

## Review Process
Once submitted, maintainers or contributors will review your report.  
They may ask for clarification or logs to help pinpoint the issue.  
Please be patient and responsive — this helps get your bug fixed faster!
